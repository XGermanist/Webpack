# Webpack
First bundle in webpack 4

My first bundle in Webpack 4. A one-button module (button.js) imported to the main file (index.js) 
along with the style for the button (button.js) and assembled in the /build folder via babel. Full version
in the archive and package.json / webpack.config / index.html files included separately.
